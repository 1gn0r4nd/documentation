## Create a Polkadot account

### PC

- You can install `Polkadot{.js} extension` for Chrome or Firefox, here is the [link](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)

- Then you need create a new account by using this extension. **AttentionÔºÅ** You **MUST** write down and secure your mnemonic seed which can be used to restore you wallet.

- And this is your Polkadot address, you can use it now!

### Mobile Device

- You can use [Polkawallet](https://polkawallet.io/) to create a new account.

- Install the app and open it, then choose `create a new account`. Also, the mnemonic seed is pretty important, please keep it safe.

## Ask Faucet for Testnet Tokens (ZBP)

- If you want to participate in this Derby, you have to get our testnet token first.

- Join in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xv8HuA4s8v) and choose faucet like this.

- Send a message like this `!drip 5Hxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 100` to get your testnet token for you account. On this command line, `5Hxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` represents your Polkadot address and `100` represents the quantity of testnet token you need.

## Make your prediction in Zeitgeist

- This is our Derby's [link](https://proto.zeitgeist.pm/kusama-derby)

- First, you need to link your wallet to our dapp. Just click this.

  ![link wallet to dapp](./../static/img/how-to/20210506190512.png)

- Now you can make a prediction! Chose one and click it.

  ![enter the prediction market](./../static/img/how-to/20210506190451.png)

- Now you can see the site you will make a prediction. On the top, you can choose which slot you wanna bet. In the middle page, you can see more visually what is happening in the current prediction market. At the bottom, you can make your prediction arbitrarily.

  ![buy & sell](./../static/img/how-to/20210506191144.png)

- If you want to **BUY** , just click `BUY` button and fill in the amount. The upper one means how many ZTG you want to bet on, and the lower one means how many **SHARES** you want to bet on. For example, if you want to bet 10 ZTG, because of the `Price` is 0.1422, you can get 10/0.1422=70.32 SHARES (without considering the **Fee**). Similarly, if you want to bet 10 SHARES, you need to pay 1.422 ZTG.
