title: Using the Faucet
---

Zeitgeist's test network [Battery Station](./battery-station) uses the ZBS
token, instead of the ZTG. ZBS is provided to users through a frictioned faucet
on Discord in order to allow for testing and experimentation.

To gain access to the faucet, an NFT from one of the following collections is
required:

-   [Zeitgeist Tarot: Fool Collection](https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/102cb9e9988c85201e-ZEITGEIST-FOOL-COLLECTION?page=1&forsale=forSale&sortBy=priceAscending)
-   [Zeitgeist Tarot: Lovers Collection](https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/102cb9e9988c85201e-ZEITGEIST-LOVERS-COLLECTION)
-   [Zeitgeist Tarot: Justice Collection](https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/102cb9e9988c85201e-ZEITGEIST-JUSTICE-TAROT-COLLECTION)
-   [Zeitgeist Tarot: Hierophant Collection](https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/102cb9e9988c85201e-ZEITGEIST-HIEROPHANT-TAROT-COLLECTION)
-   [Zeitgeist Tarot: Star Collection](https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/102cb9e9988c85201e-ZEITGEIST-STAR-COLLECTION)

## Getting ZBS

### Using the !drip command

The normal way to get ZBS from the faucet is to use the !drip command.

-   First create a new Zeitgeist account (standard Substrate account) using the
    Polkadot-JS Extension that is available
    [here](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).
-   Follow the instructions
    [here](./how-to-participate-in-derby#create-a-zeitgeist-account) for
    creating an account.
-   Go to Zeitgeist's Discord server and enter into the #faucet channel.
-   Copy your address from the extension, ensure that it's in Substrate generic
    or Battery Station format (begins with either a "5" or "d").
-   Type in `!drip <address>` to the faucet channel.
-   The faucet should respond that it sent you some ZBS.
-   After completing this you will have a 24 hour cooldown until you can get
    more ZBS.
