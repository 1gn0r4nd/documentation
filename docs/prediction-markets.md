## Info Problems

In Robin Hansen's paper "Shall We Vote on Values, But Bet on Beliefs?" the
author describes the core problem that prediction markets solve as democracy's
info problems. That is, there is a hole in which information should be aggregated
that leads to inefficient and non-optimal policies to be chosen.

## Speculative Markets

In relation to the info problems described above, Hansen (in the same paper)
points out that speculative markets show striking success in their ability
to aggregate information. He says "That is, active speculative markets do very
well at inducing people to acquire info, share it via trades, and collect that
info into consensus prices that persuade wider audiences."
